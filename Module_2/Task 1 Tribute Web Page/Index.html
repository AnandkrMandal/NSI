                There are a host of reasons why Ratan Naval Tata is worthy of admiration,
                none more so than for the way he has sailed through the high tide of his life as head of the Tata group:
                with grace and a quiet dignity all too rare in the tumult and cacophony that characterise the mostly
                grubby,
                sometimes noble intersection of business and life in today’s India.

                    <p>The quietude is what sets him apart. You would expect a person such as Mr Tata, 
                        tall of stature and blessed with the typically striking looks of his Persian forbears,
                         to stand out in a crowd. Not so the helmsman of the Tata group, whose solitary nature,
                        humility and intense effort to shun the arch lights can make him seem almost invisible in any gathering.
                        The rectitude and resolve behind this persona is of more consequence, though, defining as they have the shape and substance of a remarkable business conglomerate during what has been the most transformative period in its long and storied history.
                        Every chairman of Tata Sons — the holding company that is the fastener keeping the many disparate elements of the whole together — has left an indelible imprint on the group.
